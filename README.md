# Gui calculator
A Calculator developed by python Gui Interface. I use Tkinter here.
This calculator is not fully scientific but can operate many operrations like TrigonoMetry value determine,factorial,root,square root,power,exeponent value,log etc
Note:It is important that you have to to put operand first to calculate value from those operation. Addition,substraction,multiplication,division follow general calculator's rule.
